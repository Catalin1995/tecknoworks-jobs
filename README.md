Tecknoworks Rails TecknoworksJobs App
=====================================

To compile the webapp see [this](webapp/README.md).

It would be nice if we would use a template for the angular app instead of this custom mini app.

What is inside?

* [rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
* [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) is a flexible authentication solution for Rails.
* [active_admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) for creating elegant backends for website administration.
