Our developers inject innovation and creativity into our projects, they are respected for their knowledge, skill, and ability to solve technical challenges (even when it seems impossible). In addition to the obvious developer skills (producing fantastic code and talking about the latest gadgets), our developers must be able to continue to develop their knowledge and skills in new technologies; we believe being a geek is central to this role. Developing software is sometimes challenging, however, if you like to think about software till your brain hurts and create beautiful code, whilst developing your own knowledge, you may just solve the riddle of the universe at Tecknoworks.
