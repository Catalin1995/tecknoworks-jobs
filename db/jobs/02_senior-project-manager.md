## Senior Project Manager

#### Job description:

Tecknoworks is looking for an inspirational project manager to join our team. As a project manager you are the central force in driving the project forward. Our project managers inject energy into the project, they are respected for their knowledge, leadership, and ability to keep smiling and positive (even when the project gets difficult). In addition, to the obvious project management skills (steering the ship, whilst producing fantastic Gantt charts and management reports), our project managers must maintain a dynamic harmony between the delivery team, clients and other stakeholders; we believe personality is central to this role. Project management isn't for the faint hearted, but if you like a challenge and a dynamically different career whilst leading a project to successful completion, read on!

#### Candidate profile:

*   Science (including management science) higher education qualification, and/or diverse and interesting life experience 
*   Project management experience of at least 3 - 5 years 
*   Experience of small projects ($ 2 million) 
*   Must have been successful in managing a portfolio of projects within a PMO framework for multiple customers through the entire project  lifecycle from scoping, to development and QA to production implementation and support 
*   Proficient in managing highly complex projects within a Technology organisation - Web, desktop, mobile 
*   Ability to speak geek, so knowing the difference between your HTML and XML is essential 
*   Personality, a positive outlook, and caring persona (you’re the daddy of the project) 
*   Razor-sharp communication both oral and written (you have to be able to win hearts and minds with words) 
*   Stakeholder engagement and management  (you have to be able to play to egos and politics typical in managing a group of people, understanding their goals and ensuring they feel part of project) 
*   Ability to lead a team supporting the members in their work (as opposed to leading through fear, not the 'Tecknoworks' way) 
*   Knowledge of project management frameworks including PMP, PRINCE2 and/or MSP 
*   Knowledge and experience of industries including eCommerce / health / business intelligence / media 
*   Knowledge and experience of the software development life cycle (Kanban and/or Scrum)
