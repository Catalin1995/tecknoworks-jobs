## Senior Business Analyst

#### Job description:

Tecknoworks is looking for a smart and energetic business analyst to join our team. As a business analyst you are critical in the delivery of high quality software. Our business analysts are at the forefront of defining the blue print for our customers products and services, they are respected for their attention to detail and business acumen (even in the most complex of business processes). In addition to the obvious business analysis skills (defining requirements, mapping business processes and defining personas), our business analysts must be able to apply innovative technologies in the capture of requirements, such as user analytics and eye tracking; we believe being a geek is central to this role. Defining innovative and high-value software is sometimes challenging, however, if you like to apply technology enabling businesses to achieve a competitive edge, whilst developing your own knowledge, you may just find a way to solve world hunger at Tecknoworks.
