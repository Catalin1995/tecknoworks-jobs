## Senior QA

#### Job description:

Tecknoworks is looking for an eagle-eyed tester to join our team. As a tester you are the mother in the delivery of high quality software. Our testers inject an ethos of quality and maintain a quality standard into our projects, they are respected for their knowledge, skill, and ability to identify the things that no one else considered (including the end user). In addition to the obvious tester skills (executing value adding tests and annoying the developers with JIRA bugs), our testers must be able to continue to develop their knowledge and skills in new technologies; we believe being a geek is central to this role. Developing quality software is sometimes challenging, however, if you like to leave no stone unturned and can't go to sleep at night knowing there is an exception you've not tested, whilst developing your own knowledge, you may just find a way to bring order to the universe at Tecknoworks.

#### Candidate profile:

*   Ideally a Bachelors of Science in Computing or other mathematical or science discipline and/or significant computing experience; however, we take candidates who have completed other courses and have a genuine interest in a career in IT 
*   Software testing experience of at least 3 years 
*   Genuine interest and passion for technology including Web, desktop and mobile applications (geeks welcome) 
*   Skilled in identifying the quality criteria for a product (and client) and developing a corresponding quality strategy 
*   Skilled in test planning 
*   Skilled in executing manual functional tests 
*   Skilled in designing and driving forward automated tests 
*   Skilled in executing exploratory testing 
*   Attention to detail (you must be detail orientated) and ability challenge the assumptions of the team (in a constructive and positive way) 
*   Ability to clearly communicate testing findings and how to achieve the necessary quality 
*   Ability to organize work to ensure adequate and appropriate test coverage 
*   Experience collaborating in a variety of project environments (e.g Agile vs. Waterfall) 
*   Ability to work within a diverse team of skill and personality in the delivery of high-quality products (we like quality) 
*   Ability to give constructive and development feedback on the work of others 
*   Working knowledge of English
